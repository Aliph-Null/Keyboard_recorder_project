# Keyboard_recorder_project

This is tha lates project I've been working on, it is incomplete, barely working. If you want ot try it yourself you're welcome to.

Step 1: Downlaod the 5 files
Step 2: put all in the same folder
Step 3: Extract the .zip file as you would do normaly
Step 4: Open the repostory with unit hub and start the project

There are quite a lot of flaws in the code or maybe even in the concept itself, anyway, if you can improve the code in any way then we are welcome to new ideas.
Remember to build the app before running it. Do not run in the editor, it may lead to crashes.
